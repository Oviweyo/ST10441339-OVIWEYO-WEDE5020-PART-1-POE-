CTRL//FRAME
CTRL//FRAME is a creative studio built on disruption and fearless design, aiming to empower brands, communities, and creators through expressive, immersive, and socially relevant work. Focused on questioning norms and shaping trends rather than following them, it treats design as a narrative tool for liberation, connection, and impact. Founded as a creative lab blending control (“CTRL”) and perspective (“FRAME”), it thrives on experimentation, collaboration, and originality, valuing emotion, curiosity, and bold ideas over convention and polish to help creators reclaim their canvas and amplify their voices.
